# Bootstrap-Portfolio
This is a placeholder README for my first bootstrap attempt (HW w2)

- I took some liberties for several reasons:
    * personal aesthetics && originality
    * disconnect between bootstrap and formatting without css (including backgrounds, colors, fonts, and sizing within components)
    * lack of IDE plug-in to assist in Bootstrap extensions
    * parent v. child v. container confusion
    * some confusion on which component to choose for my design
    * running out of time (and excuses) before Saturday
    * want to get started on javascript to keep up with the lectures
    * suspect I'm not getting the "mobile first" responsiveness that's expected but I'm not sure what's missing / need feedback

- office hours regularly attended with questions asked as needed; tutoring time was used; however, little progress was made as a result (though there was one tech problem solved -- but one also made worse)

- I'm leaving these html files as-is for now, pending extra time in the week to polish and get up-to-spec; but I'm also banking on a bonus point or two for including 'release notes' with my submission (yay me!)

- If a TA has the time and is willing, perhaps a few minutes going over my code would help me bridge some gaps? I have no problems with the broad concepts and logic, but I do have trouble moving from theory to architecture and then syntax.

- Head pounding continues. Frustrations ebb and flow. Carpet bubbles and debugging continue their plague. Use of homework time === inefficient. I think TA feedback is required to move forward at this point in the howework cycle.

- "google fu" is often useful; search terms sometimes elude, however, because I cannot always specify what's wrong or theorize on a possible solution; identifying problems with specificity contiues to elude me. (For example, I know that my card component spacing (float, display, wrap, justify, etc.) is incorrect, but I haven't a clue as to why nor do I at present know how to search for a solution.)

- I continue to have git command line confusion and SSH annoyances; 

- Why are developers so married to archaic command line interfaces? GUIs exist for a reason. Ubuntu was created for a reason.

- I'm not sure if anyone is 'listening', but writing these 'release notes' was cathartic.
